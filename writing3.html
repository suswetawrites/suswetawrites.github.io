        <h1>Article for Project BachpanShala</h1>

        <p>Childhood doesn’t wait; neither should dreams.</p>

        <p>Childhood, as fragile and fleeting as it is, is often taken for granted: celebrated in textbooks, recited in policy documents, yet rarely experienced in its full vibrancy by those who most need it.</p>

        <p>BachpanShala, an initiative of the InAmigos Foundation, intervenes in this quiet tragedy, offering children lessons in living alongside lessons in reading and arithmetic. I am reminded, as I reflect upon this, of afternoons wandering through sunlit streets of my own youth; moments of curiosity and wonder that were never dictated by structure or compulsion, yet remain inaccessible to many.</p>

        <p>At BachpanShala, children are nurtured through education that excites, healthcare that sustains, and safe spaces that encourage self-expression. Mentorship programs, skill-building workshops, and community engagement reignite curiosity, foster confidence, and allow dreams to germinate in soil previously barren. Each activity and every gesture becomes a quiet act of resistance against circumstances that seek to limit potential.</p>

        <p>Supporting BachpanShala is not charity; it is a recognition that childhood, in its purest form, is a right, not a privilege. Volunteering, donating, or amplifying this cause allows us, as participants in this journey, to rewrite futures, one child at a time.</p>

        <p>I find, in this work, a profound sense of gratitude and awe: gratitude for what we can give; awe at the resilience of children; and hope that life, despite its unpredictability, can flourish.</p>
