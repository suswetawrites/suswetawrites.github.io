<b>What Is PMDD?</b>

Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of PMS that affects around 3–8% of menstruating women. It is characterized by extreme emotional and physical symptoms that occur during the luteal phase (the week or two before menstruation).

<b>Common PMDD symptoms include:</b>
<ul>
<li>Severe mood swings</li>
<li>Anxiety and irritability</li>
<li>Depression or hopelessness</li>
<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
<li>Fatigue and low energy</li>
<li>Physical discomfort: bloating, breast tenderness, headaches</li>
</ul>
Unlike PMS, PMDD symptoms are more intense and can interfere with work, studies, and personal relationships.

<b>Why Struggling with PMDD Is So Hard</b>

PMDD doesn’t just cause physical discomfort — it deeply impacts mental and emotional health. Many women report:
<ui>
Feeling unlike themselves during the premenstrual phase.
* Experiencing conflict in relationships due to irritability.
* Losing productivity at work or school.
* Struggling with depression and intrusive thoughts.
</ui>
Because PMDD is often misunderstood, many women go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed with depression or anxiety disorders.
